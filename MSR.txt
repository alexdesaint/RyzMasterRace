MSR0000_020[0...E] [Variable-Size MTRRs Base] (Core::X86::Msr::MtrrVarBase)
Reset: 0000_XXXX_XXXX_X00Xh.
Each MTRR (Core::X86::Msr::MtrrVarBase, Core::X86::Msr::MtrrFix_64K through Core::X86::Msr::MtrrFix_4K_7, or
Core::X86::Msr::MTRRdefType) specifies a physical address range and a corresponding memory type (MemType)
associated with that range. Setting the memory type to an unsupported value results in a #GP.

The variable-size MTRRs come in pairs of base and mask registers (MSR0000_0200 and MSR0000_0201 are the first
pair, etc.). Variables MTRRs are enabled through Core::X86::Msr::MTRRdefType[MtrrDefTypeEn]. A core access--with
address CPUAddr--is determined to be within the address range of a variable-size MTRR if the following equation is
true:
CPUAddr[47:12] & PhyMask[47:12] == PhyBase[47:12] & PhyMask[47:12].

For example, if the variable MTRR spans 256 KB and starts at the 1 MB address the PhyBase would be set to
0_0010_0000h and the PhyMask to F_FFFC_0000h (with zeros filling in for bits[11:0]). This results in a range from
0_0010_0000h to 0_0013_FFFFh.

Core::X86::Msr::MTRRdefType[MtrrDefTypeFixEn,MtrrDefTypeEn]. For addresses below 1MB, the appropriate Fixed
MTRRs override the default access destination. Each fixed MTRR includes two bits, RdDram and WrDram, that
determine the destination based on the access type. Writing reserved MemType values causes an error-on-write.

MSR0000_026A [Fixed-Size MTRRs] (Core::X86::Msr::MtrrFix_4K_2)
See Core::X86::Msr::MtrrVarBase for general MTRR information. Fixed MTRRs are enabled through
Core::X86::Msr::MTRRdefType[MtrrDefTypeFixEn,MtrrDefTypeEn]. For addresses below 1MB, the appropriate Fixed
MTRRs override the default access destination. Each fixed MTRR includes two bits, RdDram and WrDram, that
determine the destination based on the access type. Writing reserved MemType values causes an error-on-write.

See Core::X86::Msr::MtrrVarBase for general MTRR information. Fixed MTRRs are enabled through
Core::X86::Msr::MTRRdefType[MtrrDefTypeFixEn,MtrrDefTypeEn]. For addresses below 1MB, the appropriate Fixed
MTRRs override the default access destination. Each fixed MTRR includes two bits, RdDram and WrDram, that
determine the destination based on the access type. Writing reserved MemType values causes an error-on-write.

See Core::X86::Msr::MtrrVarBase for general MTRR information. Fixed MTRRs are enabled through
Core::X86::Msr::MTRRdefType[MtrrDefTypeFixEn,MtrrDefTypeEn]. For addresses below 1MB, the appropriate Fixed
MTRRs override the default access destination. Each fixed MTRR includes two bits, RdDram and WrDram, that
determine the destination based on the access type. Writing reserved MemType values causes an error-on-write.

MSRC000_0104 [Time Stamp Counter Ratio] (Core::X86::Msr::TscRateMsr)
Reset: 0000_0001_0000_0000h.
Core::X86::Msr::TscRateMsr allows the hypervisor to control the guest's view of the Time Stamp Counter. It provides a
multiplier that scales the value returned when Core::X86::Msr::TSC[TSC], Core::X86::Msr::MPERF[MPERF], and
Core::X86::Msr::MPerfReadOnly[MPerfReadOnly] are read by a guest running under virtualization. This allows the
hypervisor to provide a consistent TSC, MPERF, and MPerfReadOnly rate for a guest process when moving that process
between cores that have a differing P0 rate. The TSC Ratio MSR does not affect the value read from the TSC, MPERF,
and MPerfReadOnly MSRs when read when in host mode or when virtualization is not being used or when accessed by
code executed in system management mode (SMM) unless the SMM code is executed within a guest container. The TSC
Ratio value does not affect the rate of the underlying TSC, MPERF, and MPerfReadOnly counters, or the value that gets
written to the TSC, MPERF, and MPerfReadOnly MSRs counters on a write by either the host or the guest. The TSC
Ratio MSR contains a fixed-point number in 8.32 format, which is 8 bits of integer and 32 bits of fraction. This number
is the ratio of the desired P0 frequency to the P0 frequency of the core. The reset value of the TSC Ratio MSR is 1.0,
which results in a guest frequency matches the core P0 frequency.

Core::X86::Msr::SMI_ON_IO_TRAP and Core::X86::Msr::SMI_ON_IO_TRAP_CTL_STS provide a mechanism for
executing the SMI handler if a an access to one of the specified addresses is detected. Access address and access type
checking is performed before IO instruction execution. If the access address and access type match one of the specified
IO address and access types, then: (1) the IO instruction is not executed; (2) any breakpoint, other than the single-step
breakpoint, set on the IO instruction is not taken (the single-step breakpoint is taken after resuming from SMM); and (3)
issue the SMI-trigger IO cycle specified by Core::X86::Msr::SmiTrigIoCycle if enabled. The status is stored in
Core::X86::Smm::LocalSmiStatus[IoTrapSts].
IO-space configuration accesses are special IO accesses. An IO access is defined as an IO-space configuration access
when IO instruction address bits[31:0] are CFCh, CFDh, CFEh, or CFFh when IO-space configuration is enabled
(IO::IoCfgAddr[ConfigEn]). The access address for a configuration space access is the current value of
IO::IoCfgAddr[BusNo,Device,Function,RegNo]. The access address for an IO access that is not a configuration access is
equivalent to the IO instruction address, bits[31:0].
The access address is compared with SmiAddr, and the instruction access type is compared with the enabled access types
defined by ConfigSMI, SmiOnRdEn, and SmiOnWrEn. Access address bits[23:0] can be masked with SmiMask. IO and
configuration space trapping to SMI applies only to single IO instructions; it does not apply to string and REP IO
instructions. The conditional GP fault described by Core::X86::Msr::HWCR[IoCfgGpFault] takes priority over this trap.

This holds the base of the SMM memory region. The value of this register is stored in the save state on entry into SMM
(see 2.1.8.1.5 [SMM Save State]) and it is restored on returning from SMM. The 16-bit CS (code segment) selector is
loaded with SmmBase[19:4] on entering SMM. SmmBase[3:0] is required to be 0. The SMM base address can be
changed in two ways:
    • The SMM base address, at offset FF00h in the SMM state save area, may be changed by the SMI handler. The
        RSM instruction updates SmmBase with the new value.
    • Normal WRMSR access to this register.

See 2.1.8.1 [System Management Mode (SMM)] and 2.1.3.3.1 [Memory Access to the Physical Address Space]. See
Core::X86::Msr::SMMMask for more information about the ASeg and TSeg address ranges.

Each CPU access, directed at CPUAddr, is determined to be in the TSeg range if the following is true:

CPUAddr[47:17] & TSegMask[47:17] == TSegBase[47:17] & TSegMask[47:17].

For example, if TSeg spans 256 KB and starts at the 1 MB address. The Core::X86::Msr::SMMAddr[TSegBase[47:17]]
would be set to 0010_0000h and the Core::X86::Msr::SMMMask[TSegMask[47:17]] to FFFC_0000h (with zeros filling
in for bits[16:0]). This results in a TSeg range from 0010_0000 to 0013_FFFFh.

Configurable. Reset: 0000_0000_0000_0000h.
See 2.1.8.1 [System Management Mode (SMM)].
The ASeg address range is located at a fixed address from A0000h–BFFFFh. The TSeg range is located at a variable base
(specified by Core::X86::Msr::SMMAddr[TSegBase[47:17]]) with a variable size (specified by
Core::X86::Msr::SMMMask[TSegMask[47:17]]). These ranges provide a safe location for SMM code and data that is
not readily accessible by non-SMM applications. The SMI handler can be located in one of these two ranges, or it can be
located outside these ranges. These ranges must never overlap each other.
This register specifies how accesses to the ASeg and TSeg address ranges are controlled as follows:

     •   If [A,T]Valid == 1, then:
              • If in SMM, then:
                      • If [A, T]Close == 0, then the accesses are directed to DRAM with memory type as specified in
                          [A, T]MTypeDram.
                      • If [A, T]Close == 1, then instruction accesses are directed to DRAM with memory type as
                          specified in [A, T]MTypeDram and data accesses are directed at MMIO space and with
                          attributes based on [A, T]MTypeIoWc.
              • If not in SMM, then the accesses are directed at MMIO space with attributes based on
                 [A,T]MTypeIoWc.

Reset: 0000_0000_0000_0000h.
See 2.1.12 [Instruction Based Sampling (IBS)].
The IBS fetch sampling engine is described as follows:
    • The periodic fetch counter is an internal 20-bit counter:
            • The periodic fetch counter [19:4] is set to IbsFetchCnt[19:4] and the periodic fetch counter [3:0] is set
                according to IbsRandEn when IbsFetchEn is changed from 0 to 1.
            • It increments for every fetch cycle that completes when IbsFetchEn == 1 and IbsFetchVal == 0.
                      • The periodic fetch counter is undefined when IbsFetchEn == 0 or IbsFetchVal == 1.
            • When IbsFetchCnt[19:4] is read it returns the current value of the periodic fetch counter [19:4].
    • When the periodic fetch counter reaches {IbsFetchMaxCnt[19:4],0h} and the selected instruction fetch
        completes or is aborted:
            • IbsFetchVal is set to 1.
                      • Drivers can't assume that IbsFetchCnt[19:4] is 0 when IbsFetchVal == 1.
    • The status of the operation is written to the IBS fetch registers (this register,
        Core::X86::Msr::IBS_FETCH_LINADDR and Core::X86::Msr::IBS_FETCH_PHYSADDR).
    • An interrupt is generated as specified by Core::X86::Msr::IBS_CTL. The interrupt service routine associated
        with this interrupt is responsible for saving the performance information stored in IBS execution registers.

See 2.1.12 [Instruction Based Sampling (IBS)].
The IBS execution sampling engine is described as follows for IbsOpCntCtl == 1. If IbsOpCntCtl == 1n then references
to “periodic op counter" mean “periodic cycle counter".
    • The periodic op counter is an internal 27-bit counter:
             • It is set to IbsOpCurCnt[26:0] when IbsOpEn is changed from 0 to 1.
             • It increments every dispatched op when IbsOpEn == 1 and IbsOpVal == 0.
                      • The periodic op counter is undefined when IbsOpEn == 0 or IbsOpVal == 1.
             • When IbsOpCurCnt[26:0] is read then it returns the current value of the periodic micro-op counter
                [26:0].
    • When the periodic micro-op counter reaches IbsOpMaxCnt:
             • The next dispatched micro-op is tagged if IbsOpCntCtl == 1. A valid op in the next dispatched line is
                tagged if IbsOpCntCtl == 0. See IbsOpCntCtl.
             • The periodic micro-op counter [26:7]=0; [6:0] is randomized by hardware.
    • The periodic micro-op counter is not modified when a tagged micro-op is flushed.
    • When a tagged micro-op is retired:
             • IbsOpVal is set to 1.
                      • Drivers can't assume that IbsOpCurCnt is 0 when IbsOpVal == 1.
    • The status of the operation is written to the IBS execution registers (this register, Core::X86::Msr::IBS_OP_RIP,
        Core::X86::Msr::IBS_OP_DATA, Core::X86::Msr::IBS_OP_DATA2, Core::X86::Msr::IBS_OP_DATA3,
